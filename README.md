- **File Interpretation:** All files will be interpreted on Chrome (version 57.0)
- **File Endings:** All files should end with a new line
- **README.md:** A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- **Code Style:** Your code should be semistandard compliant with the flag `--global $`: `semistandard *.js --global $`
- **JavaScript Files:** All your JavaScript must be in the `scripts` folder
- **jQuery Version:** You must use jQuery version 3.x
